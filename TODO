Commands:

`rx fetch`
	Poll for the available updates to repositories

	This should be able to use commands like
		git ls-remote origin master
		git show-ref origin/master
	to see whether there are updates available for
	repositories.  If there are,
		git fetch origin
	and friends can pull down the new refs.

`rx update`
	Try to update a given package.

`rx cabinet`
	The equivalent of `git stash save` and friends.

	Ideas for cabinet file format:
		- Use gob (nicely forward compatible)
		- Store dependent repos and their hash
		- Store more?
